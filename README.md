The Project does include: 

 - HTML 
 - CSS Background Properties
 - CSS Transform Properties
 - CSS Grids
 - Dark/Light theme
 - Name at the bottom of the project 
 - Basic javascript functions.

 🎯 Practical rule of thumb:  

Use function when you want hoisting (e.g., helper functions at the bottom of a script).  Also Arrow Function (same as function expression) (Function expression not hoisted)

Use const for modern modular code — it’s predictable and scoped to its block.

⚠️ var is hoisted too — but only the declaration, not the value.
This is why var can lead to weird bugs, and let / const are preferred now.
